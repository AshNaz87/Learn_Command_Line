1) What does the command `cat` stand for?

2) What does concatenate mean?

3) Using the up arrow, print to the screen the following words (in programming anything wrapped around quotation marks, single or double, are known as `strings`), 'inni', 'minni', 'minie', 'mo', without retyping `echo` each time.

4) Type in a long command of your own. Now using `Opt` + left click, select some some text and modify it. Do this a couple of times, until you get a feel of how this works.

5) Experiment and find a way to print out `Use "man clear"` onto the screen. Remember the key to get out of trouble if something unexpected happens :)

6) Execute the command `man sleep` and figure out how to make the terminal "sleep" for 10 seconds.
