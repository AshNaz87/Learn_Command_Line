1) Using `echo` and the redirect operator, make a file called "foo.txt", which contains the words "Happy coding!".

    Then use `cp` to copy the file as "bar.txt"
    
    Use `diff` to make sure both contents are the same.

2) Do the same thing as above, using the `cat` command (on foo.txt) and redirect operator. Call the new file "baz.txt".

3) Create a file named quux.txt containing both contents from "foo.txt" and "bar.txt"

    *Hint* Use the `cat` command
    
4) Type the sequence of commands needed to create an empty file called "alpha", rename it to "beta" and then copy it to "gamma".

5) Don't type this in the terminal, but what do you think the command would be to remove all files which start with "b"? (remember the wilcard operator, "*")

6) Use the command `curl -I https://curl.haxx.se/` to fetch the HTTP header.

7) The `history` command prints the history of commands in a particular terminal shell. Pipe `history` to `less` to examine your command history. What was your 25th command?

8) By piping the output of history to wc, count how many commands youâ€™ve executed so far.

9) What do the `-O` and `-L` options in Listing 10 mean? Hint: Pipe the output of `curl -h` to less and search first for the string `-O` and then for the string `-L`.
